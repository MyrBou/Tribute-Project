    <h2 id="tribute-info">About</h2>
    <p><b><em>"The Walking Dead"</em></b> is a gripping American TV series based on the comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It follows a diverse group of survivors navigating life in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, known as "walkers." As they struggle to survive the constant threat of these undead creatures, they also face challenges from other human groups, each with its own rules and values, often resulting in conflicts. This show marked the inception of The Walking Dead franchise on television.<p>

<p>The series boasts a talented cast, with <a href="#Rick">Andrew Lincoln</a> leading until the ninth season. Notable long-standing members include <a href="#Daryl">Norman Reedus</a>, Steven Yeun, Chandler Riggs, <a href="#Carol">Melissa McBride</a>, <a href="#Maggie">Lauren Cohan</a>, Danai Gurira, Josh McDermitt, Christian Serratos, Seth Gilliam, Ross Marquand, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Filmed primarily in Georgia at Riverwood Studios, the show has been a production of AMC Studios. Initially adapted by Frank Darabont, conflicts led to his departure, with subsequent showrunners including Glen Mazzara, Scott M. Gimple, and Angela Kang.<p>

<p>Debuting on October 31, 2010, the series aired exclusively on AMC in the US and internationally through Fox Networks Group and Disney+. Its eleventh and final season premiered in August 2021 and concluded in November 2022.
